# Building a simple game with Phaser

This project aims to build a simple animation with Phaser, which is a very easy-to-use tool to develop game for Javascript enthusiasts.

_Note:_ This code is re-factored based on the implementation of [ansimuz](https://github.com/ansimuz/getting-started-with-phaser.git). Therefore, I highly recommend watching instructions from the author at [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frRWKxB9Hm0&list=PLDyH9Tk5ZdFzEu_izyqgPFtHJJXkc79no&index=1).
